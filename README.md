# Satellite Data

I've always been interested in understanding how satellites work. I found a dataset from the Union of Concerned Scientists about the amount of satellites "in the world", and so I was curious about some fo the information regarding that. I also am a big pandas person, and I was curious about polars and how "quick" it is, so it's a good opportunity to get my hands dirty with it.
